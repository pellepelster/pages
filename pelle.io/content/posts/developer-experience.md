A personal pet peeve of mine when joining a new project or environment is the overall developer experience (DX). Under
this rather wide umbrella term I summarize everything that is needed to get a project running, tested and deployed apart
from the actual business code itself. Starting on the local development environment setup, over being able to build and
test locally to finally being able to deploy and operate the project without any friction.

In the following series of posts I will try to visit some recurring patterns, problems and obstacles and give and
provide some heavily opinionated approaches on how to solve them.
