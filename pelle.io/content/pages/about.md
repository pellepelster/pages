I am a Freelance Software Developer and Infrastructure Specialist. 

I can help you to continuously deliver software to the cloud or on-premise, using test-first methodologies. With my experience from the transition of on-premise datacenters to cloud based solutions I can help you to migrate existing products and services to the cloud, or back.

My operational background helps me to develop systems that are easy to operate, monitor and debug. I strongly believe in test driven development, both for software and infrastructure code.

I enjoy diving into existing systems and to stabilize and overhaul the software, or it's infrastructure.
