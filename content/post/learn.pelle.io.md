Beginning with this post I will start a series of tutorials revolving around the problems and obstacles you typically encounter when deploying web applications to Amazon Web Services. Focus of the tutorials are best practices and hands on examples for topics like scaling, monitoring, continuous delivery/deployment, testing, security and operability with an emphasis all aspects concerning the infrastructure of web application deployments.   
Every step of the tutorial comes complete with executable sourcecode that you can check out and try locally. 
The idea is to iteratively develop and extend the solution and to provide example code for every step so you can easily follow the development.
The first chapter will give an overview of the application and guide you through an initial simplistic deployment, followed by  various refinements. Have a look at [http://learn.pelle.io/](http://learn.pelle.io/) for the first chapter and reach out to me for feedback if you like.
